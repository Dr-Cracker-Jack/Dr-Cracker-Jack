So someone solved asyncronised php (kungfuPHP) ?

You simply need ajax and php.



header('Location: '.$newURL);

Then your webpage whit ajax calling two php pages.

To start simple on the fist page 'page1.php' write one (echo '1';)

then on the second page 'page2.php' put (sleep 5; echo'2';)

Make a buty css to fit these two page on your server to make a whois and a domaine price if avai;able but a fully loaded page whitout waiting for ypur registag server answere...
